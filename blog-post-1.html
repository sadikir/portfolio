                <p>Coding is an amazing skill to have. The ability to turn your thoughts into amazing works of art consumes my bones. You never get bored with coding. As long as there is something to create, the enthusiasm never diminishes. And the more you create the more experienced you become with coding. It’s learning in progress.
I feel like everyone should learn coding and computer science in general. I don’t think there is a field of study as interesting as the science of computers. But many people shy away from computers saying that it's hard to grasp. With more practice everything becomes easy. Once you know the basics it's very easy to pick up the advanced stuff.
This is how I taught myself to code from beginner to passionate coder.

                <p>I remember when I was still young at 4 years old, I used to take apart my father’s watches and radio to see what makes the watch stick move continuously and to see the people talking in a small box like a radio. It was curiosity at a young age. My father resented me for breaking his equipment. 
When I was 10 our home light was made by me from recycled batteries and wires. I could help my neighbours too to get light in their house. I remember failing so many times at generating bio electricity from wastes and latrines. At 13 I put down recycled materials in an attempt to create a radio transmitter several times but it failed.

                <p>I did not touch computers until I owned one. My aunt from Denmark sent me a computer while I was in Kampala Uganda. This was a gem. I had not touched computers before but it did not take long until I started picking up stuff on my own. I started with playing music, and games.
I used to browse the internet sometimes. One day I wanted to have my own wikipedia page but failed to understand how they do it. This led me to understand that websites are created somehow by people. I wanted to learn how they are created. With a couple days of trying different things I learned about the C++ language and the book about C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup. I learned from that book day and night until I had a little bit of knowledge about C++ and programming in general. I learned quickly that it will take me a couple months until I create a software with GUI(graphical user interface) by coding with C++. It did not take long until I started learning about the web and its technologies. Web development was better learned online but I did not have the internet. Once, I asked how to download the whole of W3schools to use it offline. There was no offline interactive learning platform at that time. Internet access was a big problem for me. But I kept learning anyway.
</p>
              <p>At some point I was so consumed by coding and entrepreneurship that I quit school and told my father to give me that money for school fees so I could buy a better computer. He agreed!
After buying this computer I spent days and nights trying to learn. When I got sick my family suspected it's because I spent so much time on the computer. I had no social life.

When we came to Canada, I felt like all my dreams would come true. I’m in a place with unlimited internet and access to computer power. I was so excited. It didn’t take long until I got a computer from my uncle and continued my journey of learning. I remember being so excited after I created my own personal portfolio website. I never stopped learning.
I went on the freecodecamp.org website to refresh my knowledge and completed their front end course and got a certificate. I completed the backend course and am waiting for the certificate after I do the challenges..
Now I am on a mission to create a non-profit that makes coding materials available to people offline. I want to have an interactive platform that people can install on their computer offline. This way people from lower
